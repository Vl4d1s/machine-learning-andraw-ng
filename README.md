# Machine Learning Online course in Coursera
Created by: Standford University.
Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction
This repository contains my programming assignments for Andrew Ng's Coursera Class. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
Topics include: 

1. **Supervised learning:** parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks.

2. **Unsupervised learning:** clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning. 

3. **Best practices in machine learning:** bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI. 

## Programming Assignments

There were 8 programming exercises for the course covering the following topics:

- Exercise 1 - Linear Regression
- Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression
- Exercise 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks]
- Exercise 4 - Neural Networks Learning
- Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
- Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines
- Exercise 7 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
- Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
